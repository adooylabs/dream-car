# dream-car

A tech bubble employee wants to plan for his cash windfall. He will list his favorite cars, and how much each costs. Then, given a projected cash-out amount, he wants to know what are all the possible combinations of cars he could buy. He might want more than one of his favorite cars.

For example, he lists his favorite cars as:

- Tesla $80,000
- Mercedes S class $70,000
- Delorean $120,000
- Bentley convertible $220,000
- Ferrari $158,000
- Mazda RX-7 $12,000

He thinks his companyâ€™s multi-billion-dollar IPO will bring in $8,000,000. What cars can he buy, and how many of each? It is theoretically possible that he would want to buy 100 Teslas and be done with it.
